# Goal:

Here we aim to download all available DNA binding protein (DBP) profiles in a single cell state (measured by ChIP-seq). This will allow us to investigate the binding properties of hundreds of DBPs in the same cellular context or background. We aim to address several questions: 
  
  (i) What are the number of peaks and genome coverage for each DBP? 
  
  (ii) What are the binding preferences for promoters, gene-bodies and intergenic genomic regions? 
  
  (iii) What are the similarities and differences across DBPs based on their genome-wide binding profiles genome-wide? 
  
  (iv) What properties or preferences do promoters have for binding events. 

(v) How does binding to a promoter affect the transcriptional output of that promoter?
  
  (vi) Are there reservoir promoters in HepG2 as defined in k562 previously? 
  
  
  
  To address these questions we have curated a set of over 1,000 ChIPseq data sets comprised of 48 DBPs in HEPG2 cells from the ENCODE consortium. We required duplicate ChIP-seq experiments for a given DBP and other criterion that can be found here :
  
  <https://www.encodeproject.org/report/?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_slims=DNA+binding&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&files.read_length=100&files.read_length=76&files.read_length=75&files.read_length=36&assay_title=Control+ChIP-seq&assay_title=Histone+ChIP-seq&files.run_type=single-ended>
  
  ## These samples were selected on the following criteria:
  
  1)  "chromatin" interaction data, then DNA binding data, cell line HEPG2, "TF-Chip-seq".
2)  We further selected "TF Chip-seq", "Control chip-seq" and "Histone Chip-seq".
3)  We selected several read lengths to get the most DNA binding proteins (DBPs)
4)  Read lengths: 100, 76, 75, 36
5)  ONLY SINGLE END READS (this eliminates 54 samples)

### Experimental data was downloading by (ENCODE report.tsv):

<https://www.encodeproject.org/report.tsv?type=Experiment&status=released&assay_slims=DNA+binding&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&files.read_length=100&files.read_length=76&files.read_length=75&files.read_length=36&assay_title=Control+ChIP-seq&assay_title=Histone+ChIP-seq&files.run_type=single-ended>
  
  ### The FASTQ files were downloaded with:
  
  "<https://www.encodeproject.org/metadata/?status=released&assay_slims=DNA+binding&biosample_ontology.term_name=HepG2&assay_title=TF+ChIP-seq&biosample_ontology.classification=cell+line&files.read_length=100&files.read_length=76&files.read_length=75&files.read_length=36&assay_title=Control+ChIP-seq&assay_title=Histone+ChIP-seq&files.run_type=single-ended&type=Experiment>"

MD5sums were checked with all passing (see encode_file_info function to reterive MD5Sum values that are not available from the encode portal (/util)
                                       
                                       ### Processing data:
                                       
                                       We processed all the read alignments and peak calling using the NF_CORE ChIP-seq pipeline: (nfcore/chipseq v1.2.2)
                                       
                                       ## Next we created consensus peaks that overlap in both replicates
                                       
                                       Our strategy was to take peaks in each replicate and find all overlapping peak windows. We then took the union length of the overlapping range in each peak window. We further required that a DBP has at least 1,000 peaks (the min quartile of peaks observed)
                                       
                                       Result: 
                                         (i) we have 430 DBPs that have at least 1,000 peaks in both replicates

                                       and dbp object. This will be done in 2 steps
                                       (1) created dbp object of unique names for dbp
                                       (2) run consensus_from_reduced

                                         (i) Gene bodies explain almost all the places of binding in the genome (.9x slope)
                                       (ii) thus roughly 90% of binding events occur within or overlap gene bodies
                                       
                                       # Density plot of binding events
                                       Let's make a density plot of num DBPs bound per promoter

```{r density plot of DBP localization events}

ggplot(peak_occurence_df, aes(x = number_of_dbp)) +
geom_density(alpha = 0.2, color = "#424242", fill = "#424242") +

  ggtitle("Promoter binding events",

Result: 
(i) very interesting that the promoter binding is bimodal !
(ii) most promoters have upto 100 dbps then a lag and 2nd dist at ~200dbs
(iii) There are two types of promoter binding - (1) normal (2) super-binders

                                       Let's compare the binding patterns of lncRNA vs mRNA promoters.

Result:
(i) in general mRNA promoters have more overlaps than lncRNAs
(ii) both have linear trend with more peaks more overlaps
(iii) mRNA promoters are 4x more likely to overlaps a dbp than lncRNA promoters
